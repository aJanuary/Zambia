My major interests in sci fi lie in classic space opera, sword &amp; planet, military sci fi, cyberpunk, and hard sci fi; my tastes in fantasy mostly run to pulp sword &amp; sorcery, with some high fantasy. Outside of those genres, I have a longstanding love for dystopian fiction in general and the post apocalypse genre specifically.
